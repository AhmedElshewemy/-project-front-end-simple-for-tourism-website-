                                The Fortress of Babylon dates from early Roman times, when a Roman legion resided in this strategic area on the apex of the Nile Delta. Apparently it was enlarged and fortified by the Emperors Trajan (98-117 A.D.) and Arcadius (395-408). Although the Fortress was sadly ruined at the turn of this century, it is considered to be one of the best preserved military structures of Roman times. Most of the walls are built of three regular layers of red bricks alternating with five stone layers, bound together with a mortar of sand, lime, pebbles and charcoal. The walls were constructed on an irregular five sided layout with numerous semi-circular bastions.
