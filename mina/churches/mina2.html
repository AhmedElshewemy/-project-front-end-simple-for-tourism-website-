        <p class="description">Because Egypt is a predominantly Muslim country, most non-Egyptians are unaware that Egypt has some of the oldest and most historically significant churches, cathedrals and monasteries in this part of the world. </p>
        <p class="description">You don’t need to be Egyptian or even Christian to appreciate the history of these centuries-old places of worship, or the beauty of the more modern ones. </p>
        <p class="description">While many of these churches can be found in Coptic Cairo, some are in more… remote places (Sinai mountains, anyone?). But whatever the destination, each of these churches, cathedrals and monasteries should be visited at least once. </p>
