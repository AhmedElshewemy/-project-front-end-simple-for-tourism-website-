    <p class="kkk">The tomb of Nefertari was discovered in 1904 and it was not opened to the public since its discovery in the early
        nineties of the last century, due to some damage to the inscriptions and decorations due to the deposition of

                name translates in different meanings as "the unparalleled beloved" or "the most beautiful of the world." Nefertari
                is one of the most famous Egyptian queens such as Cleopatra, Nefertiti and Hatshepsut. Ramses the Great lavishly
                decorated the Tomb of Nefertari QV66, which is the largest and most prominent in the Valley of the Queens.
                The cemetery was officially opened after its restoration and disposal of salt deposits from the walls of the
                cemetery in the early 1990s.
                <br>

    <p class="kkk">Ahmose the First, (meaning born from Yah) was a king from one of the kings of ancient Egypt and the
        founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and was a member of the royal family of Thebes, the son of King Sqnen Ra and
        brother of the last king of the seventeenth dynasty, King Kamus. During the reign of his father or grandfather,
        Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos, rulers of Lower Egypt. When he was seven years old, his father was killed, and
        at about ten when his brother died of unknown causes, and he only ruled for three years. Ahmose I assumed the throne
        after the death of his brother, and after his accession he became known as Neb-Petit-Ra (Master of Power Ra). Ahmose
        Theophore's name is a combination of the syllable 'ah' and the plural form '-moussa'. The syllable 'Ah' refers to
        Yah.</p>
    <p class="kkk">Ahmose developed the Egyptian army and was the first to put on it the war wheels "which were used by the
        Hyksos, which is the reason for the Hyksos overcoming Egypt." He was drawn by horses and also developed military
        weapons using darts equipped with a piece of iron on the arrows, then he began to fight the Hyksos starting from
        Upper Egypt and the people around him gathered around him. So he trained them efficiently until they became strong
        and skilled warriors, and he continued to fight the Hyksos from Upper Egypt until he reached the capital of Egypt at
        the time, which the Hyksos established next to the current city of Zagazig, and he kept fighting them until they
        fled to the northern delta and he was behind them, Sinai and then to Palestine. It is safe from them and from their
        attacks after their elimination after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and Ahmose arrived with his army to the country
        of Phenicia, and attacked the country of Nubia to retrieve it again to the Egyptian Kingdom, whose borders reached
        the south to the second cataract, and the campaigns of Ahmose in the cemetery of two of his soldiers are Ahmose bin
        Ibana and Ahmose bin Nhket

            <br>
            <p class="kkk"> After the end of Ahmose's wars to expel the enemies and secure the borders of Egypt, he turned his attention to the
                internal affairs that were rundown during the occupation of the Hyksos, reforming the tax system, reopening trade
                routes, repairing the water canals and the irrigation system.
            
                He also rebuilt the destroyed temples and took Thebes as his capital, and Amon was the official idol of his time.
                Ahmose’s rule lasted for a quarter of a century and he died at the age of 35. After Ahmose expelled the Hyksos from
                Egypt, he returned to the country in 1571 and headed for internal reform, which made historians regard him as the
                founder of the modern state.</p>

            <p class="kkk">Records of the latter part of the campaign were discovered on the tomb walls of a participating soldier,
                Ahmose, son of Ebana. These records indicate that Ahmose I led three attacks against Avaris, the Hyksos capital, but
                also had to quell a small rebellion further south in Egypt. After this, in the fourth attack, he conquered the
                city.[28] He completed his victory over the Hyksos by conquering their stronghold Sharuhen near Gaza after a
                three-year siege.[14][29] Ahmose would have conquered Avaris by the 18th or 19th year of his reign at the very
                latest. This is suggested by "a graffito in the quarry at Tura whereby 'oxen from Canaan' were used at the opening
                of the quarry in Ahmose's regnal year 22."[30] Since the cattle would probably have been imported after Ahmose's
                siege of the town of Sharuhen which followed the fall of Avaris, this means that the reign of Khamudi must have
                terminated by Year 18 or 19 of Ahmose's 25-year reign at the very latest.[30]</p>

            <br>
            <p class="kkk"></p>
            <P class="kkk">he Rhind Papyrus illustrates some of Ahmose's military strategy when attacking the Delta. Entering
                Heliopolis in July, he moved down the eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road,
                the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru[23] he cut off all traffic
                between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from
                help or supplies coming from Canaan.[27]</P>
            <P class="kkk">t ended during his reign of the invasion of the Hyksos and expelled them from the Delta region, and
                theban regained its sovereignty over all parts of Egypt and its lands previously controlled by it from Nubia and
                Canaan. He reorganized the administration of the country, opened quarries, mines, and new ways of trade, and began
                massive construction projects of the kind not undertaken since that time in the Middle Kingdom. The reign of Ahmose
                laid the foundations for the modern state, according to which the Egyptian state reached its climax. </P>
            <P class="kkk">After the end of Ahmose's wars to expel the enemies and secure the borders of Egypt, he turned his
                attention to the internal affairs that were rundown during the occupation of the Hyksos, reforming the tax system,
                reopening trade routes, repairing the water canals and the irrigation system. </P>

                <p class="kkk"> He also rebuilt the destroyed temples and took Thebes as his capital, and Amon was the official idol of
                his time. Ahmose’s rule lasted for a quarter of a century and he died at the age of 35. After Ahmose expelled the
                Hyksos from Egypt, he returned to the country in 1571 and headed for internal reform, which made historians regard
                him as the founder of the modern state.
                It is believed that Ahmose cemeteries, one in Abydos and consisting of a sloping temple, a funeral cemetery and the
                remains of a pyramid discovered in 1899, was known to be his pyramid in 1902 and a temple for the pyramid and the
                other in Thebes, which was looted by thieves. His mummy was discovered in 1881 in the Deir el-Bahari cache with the
                mummies of some of the kings of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first families, and his mummy was identified
                on June 9, 1886 by Gaston Maspero, and the length of the mummy was 1.63 cm and it had a relatively small face in
                comparison with the size of the chest.
                Ahmose began the conquest of Lower Egypt held by the Hyksos starting around the 11th year of Khamudi's reign, but
                the sequence of events is not universally agreed upon.</p>
            <p class="kkk"> Analyzing the events of the conquest prior to the siege of the Hyksos capital of Avaris is extremely
                difficult. Almost everything known comes from a brief but invaluable military commentary on the back of the Rhind
                Mathematical Papyrus, consisting of brief diary entries, [22] one of which reads</p>
            <div class="mo"> <img src="css/ah7.jpg" alt="Notebook" class="imgg"></div>
        
            <p class="kkk"> Regnal year 11, second month of shomu, Heliopolis was entered. First month of akhet, day 23, this
                southern prince broke into Tjaru.</p>
            <p class="kkk"> While in the past this regnal year date was assumed to refer to Ahmose, it is today believed instead to
                refer to Ahmose's Hyksos opponent Khamudi since the Rhind papyrus document refers to Ahmose by the inferior title of
                'Prince of the Sou</p>
            <p class="kkk"> "it is reasonable to expect a Theban-oriented text to describe its Pharaoh in this manner? For if the
                date refers to Ahmose, then the scribe must have been an adherent of that ruler. To me, the very indirect reference
                to Ahmose—it must be Ahmose—ought to indicate a supporter of the Hyksos dynasty; hence, the regnal years should
                refer to this monarch and not the Theban [king</p>

            <p class="kkk"> Tutankhamun was one of the pharaohs of the eighteenth Egyptian family in the history of
                ancient Egypt. He was the Pharaoh of Egypt from 1334 BC to 1325 BC. Tutankhamun is considered one of
                the most famous pharaohs for reasons that are not related to his achievements or the wars in which
                he won, as is the case with many pharaohs. But for other reasons that are historically important,
                and the most prominent of which is the discovery of his tomb and treasures completely without any
                damage. The mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death as many considered the death of
                Pharaoh at a very early age to be unnatural, especially with the presence of traces of fractures in
                the thigh and skull bones, and the marriage of his minister to his widow after his death and the
                inauguration of himself as Pharaoh.</p>
            <p class="kkk"> All these mysterious events and the intense use of the myth of the curse of the pharaohs
                associated with the tomb of Tutankhamun, which was used in films and video games, made Tutankhamun
                the most famous pharaohs for mysteries and questions that remain unanswered, considered by some of
                the oldest assassinations in human history. Tutankhamun died young and was buried in his tomb -
                cemetery 62 - in the Valley of the Kings. </p>

            <p class="kkk"> Tutankhamun was nine years old when he became Pharaoh of Egypt, and his name in the
                ancient Egyptian language means "the living image of the god Amun," the great ancient Egyptian
                deity. Tutankhamun lived in a transitional period in the history of ancient Egypt, where he came
                after Akhenaten, who tried to unify the gods of ancient Egypt in the form of one single god. During
                his reign, he returned to the worship of the many gods of ancient Egypt. His tomb was discovered in
                1922 in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter. The latest discovery
                sensation and widespread media in the world.</p>

            <p class="kkk"> During the rule of Tutankhamun, a revolt began from Tell el-Amarna against the movement
                of the former
                pharaoh Akhenaten, who moved the capital from Thebes to his new capital, the sister of Aton in
                Minya, and tried to
                unify the various gods of ancient Egypt, including the god Amun in the form of the one god Aton. In
                the year 1331
                BC, that is, in the third year of the rule of Tutankhamun, who was 11 years old, and under the
                influence of the
                minister, that is, to lift the ban imposed on the worship of gods.</p>

            <P class="kkk"> There is a widespread belief that the death of Tutankhamun was not due to pathological
                reasons, but may
                be as a result of an assassination that Minister Khurkhvro Ra Ay had orchestrated, and there are
                many evidences that
                are reported by the believers in this theory, including for example the marriage of Minister
                Khurakhpro Ra Ay to the
                widow of Tutankhamun, where he was found. On a Pharaonic seal bearing the name of Ay and Ank Son
                Amun, widow of
                Tutankhamun, and also there is a letter sent by Tutankhamun's widow Ankh Esen Amun to the king of
                the Hittites
                asking him to send one of his sons for the purpose of marrying her after her husband's death, and
                the king of the
                Hittites sent one of his sons to marry Tutankham's widow Amun, but he died before he entered the
                land of Egypt, and
                there is a belief that he was probably assassinated under the plan of Minister Khurakhro Ra Ay, who
                apparently was
                planning to seize the throne of Egypt, so he killed King Tutankhamun and killed the son of the king
                of the Hittites,
                but these are hypotheses and there is no conclusive evidence to prove all these theories .</P>
            <P class="kkk"> It is worth noting that historical evidence indicates the existence of two ministers for
                Tutankhamun,
                one of them Ay, who was mentioned and the other named Horemheb, and there is archaeological evidence
                confirming that
                after the death of Tutankhamun, Minister Ai received the reins of power for a short period to be
                replaced by the
                second minister Horemheb, during whose reign most of Evidence for the rule of Tutankhamun and
                Minister Ay. This
                confirms to some the conspiracy theory and the fact that Tutankhamun’s death was due to malaria,
                which was
                widespread in the south.</P>

                grooves and form small rooms in the valley and over time there were graves built over other graves

                pharaoh, this lack of organized planning was the main reason why these treasures have not been

            <p class="kkk"> The main shrine of Tutankhamun's tomb
                On November 4, 1922, when the British archaeologist and specialist in the history of ancient Egypt,
                Howard Carter,
                was excavating at the entrance to the tunnel leading to the tomb of Ramses VI in the Valley of the
                Kings, he noticed
                a large basement and continued careful excavation until he entered the room that includes the tomb
                of Tutankhamun
                and it was on the walls of the room The mausoleum contains wonderful drawings that tell in the form
                of pictures the
                story of Tutankhamun’s departure to the realm of the dead. The scene was very impressive by the
                scientist Howard
                Carter, who was looking into the room through a hole with a candle in his hand, and it is said that
                his assistant
                asked him, "Can you see anything?" To which Carter replied, "Yes, I see wonderful things."</p>
            <p class="kkk"> On February 16, 1923, Howard Carter (1874-1939) was the first person in more than 3000
                years to set foot
                on the floor of the room containing the ark of Tutankhamun. Carter noticed the presence of a wooden
                box with
                inscriptions inlaid with gold in the center of the room, and when he raised the box, he noticed that
                the box was
                covering a second box decorated with inscriptions inlaid with gold, and when he lifted the second
                box he noticed
                that the second box was covering a third box inlaid with gold. When the third box was lifted, Carter
                reached the
                stone sarcophagus. Which was covered with a thick layer of stone carved in the form of a statue of
                Tutankhamen, and
                when he raised this stone cover, Carter reached the main golden coffin, which was in the form of a
                statue of
                Tutankhamun, and this golden coffin covered two other golden sarcophagi in the form of statues of
                the young pharaoh.
                Howard had difficulty lifting the third golden shroud that was covering the mummy of Tutankhamun
                from the mummy, so
                Carter thought that exposing the shroud to the scorching heat of the summer sun of Egypt would be
                sufficient to
                separate the golden shroud from the mummy, but his attempts failed and he was forced in the end to
                cut the golden
                shroud in half to reach the mummy Who was wrapped in layers of silk, and after removing the shroud
                made of cloth, he
                found the mummy of Tutankhamun completely decorated with necklaces, rings, crown and sticks, all of
                pure gold. To
                remove these artifacts, the excavation team had to separate the skull and the main bones from its
                joints, and after
                removing the jewelry, the team reconstructed the structure. The skeleton of the mummy and put it in
                a wooden coffin.
            </p>
            <p class="kkk"> In February 2010, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism decided to allow the mummy of the
                young Pharaonic
                King Tutankhamun to be shown to the public for the first time since it was discovered with its
                golden mausoleum in
                Luxor 85 years ago.

                The director of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, Zahi Hawass, said that more than two years ago,
                Egyptian
                scientists began restoring the mummy of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was severely damaged after it was
                removed for a
                short period from its stone sarcophagus when subjected to CT imaging. He added that the bulk of the
                mummy’s body was
                broken up into 18 pieces that looked like stones. Parts were shattered when British archaeologist
                Howard Carter
                first discovered them and removed them from her grave and tried to remove the golden mask that
                covered the face of
                King Tutankhamun. He pointed out that the mystery surrounding Tutankhamun and his golden mausoleum
                The curiosity and
                enthusiasm of admirers of ancient Egyptian studies has aroused since Carter revealed the site of the
                mummy on
                November 4, 1922, and the treasures of gold and precious stones it hid.

                Scientists had taken out the mummy "Tutankhamun" from her grave and placed it on the table of
                advanced CT imaging
                for a quarter of an hour in 2005 in order to obtain a three-dimensional image of a mummy more than
                3000 years old.
                And the results of the medical examination ruled out that the young pharaoh had died, but it was not
                able to
                accurately determine the method of his death, which occurred in the year 1323 BC. The pictures
                discovered that King
                Tutankhamun suffered a fracture in his left thigh, possibly due to an accident, which led to his
                later infection
                with a fatal disease that could not be determined. The pictures also provided an unprecedented
                disclosure at the
                time about the life of the young pharaoh, who is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt,
                including that he
                was healthy due to his good nutrition despite the relatively shifting structure, whose height did
                not exceed 170 cm
                at his death. And there are strange things that happen to everyone who enters it, for example the
                first scientist
                discovered it was Matt poisoned and some believe that it is because of food and others believe that
                it is because of
                the curse of the Pharaohs</p>

                name yet because it is likely to be a compound noun. Some Egyptologists translate the name to
                “riotous or stubborn fish.” Perhaps this is due to the nature of the movement of the catfish, and

                About eight thousand years ago, the Egyptian provinces were united into two kingdoms: the Kingdom of
                Lower Egypt and the Kingdom of Upper Egypt, and each of them had an organized army, and this matter
                remained until 3425 BC when Egypt was finally unified at the hands of King Mina.

                At the beginning of the Third Dynasty, Egypt was subjected to raids by the Bedouins on its borders
                .. King Zoser hastened to lay the first building blocks in building a unified and stable army for
                Egypt .. The organization and arming of this army witnessed many developments in the eras of the
                ancient state and the middle state, as for the great development in the organization of the Egyptian
                army. It happened during the era of the New Kingdom (1552-1085 BC).

                Over these centuries, the Egyptian army fought major battles ... Battles of liberation, independence
                and suppression of enemies and greedy ones.

                In the era of the Middle Kingdom, the racial migrations in Egypt were collapsing, especially by the
                Asian groups known as the Hyksos, who were able to seize power for the first time in the history of
                Egypt .. And these invaders continued to rule Egypt for nearly a century and a half of time.

                The burden of liberating Egypt from this foreign presence fell on the shoulders of the 17th family,
                and in these wars the signs of heroism and courage were evident from the rulers and fighters, and
                some Egyptian queens participated in those wars, such as Queen Aahhotep, who supported her husband,
                Seknen Ra the Son, in his struggle against the Hyksos. Until he fell as the first martyr for the
                sake of Egypt, so his son, Ahmose I, completed the liberation of the land of Egypt, and Ahmose the
                First was considered the hero of Egypt's independence in the Old Testament and expelled the Hyksos
