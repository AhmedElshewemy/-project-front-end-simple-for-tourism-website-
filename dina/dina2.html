          <li class="kkk">Despite the poorly preserved ruins and the presence of some of the most attractive monuments
            of
            Karnak,
            this temple forms. The largest ancient religious building in the world</li>
          <li class="kkk">Although it was badly destroyed, the tourist attractions became scarce relative to the rest of
            the
            temples in Egypt. This particular temple is one of the largest religious temples in the world, and
            it
            represents the common achievement of many generations of the builders of Egypt. The Karnak Temple
            consists of the three main Egyptian temples, the smaller enclosed temples, and the outer temple,
            which
            is located 2.5 kilometers north of Luxor. It took thousands of years to build this temple to be one
            of
            the largest temples and It took millennia to build and enhance the massive Karnak Temple. Most of
            the work was done at Karnak by the pharaohs of the New Kingdom (1570-1100
            BC). One of the most famous structures in Karnak is the Colonnaded Foyer, the Hall (5,000 m2 (50,000
            sq
            ft), with 134 colossal columns arranged in 16 rows.</li>
          <li class="kkk">It is the largest and most important Egyptian temple. The ancient Egyptians called it "Ibt
            Sot,"
            which
            means
            "the chosen spot for the thrones of Amun." Where he was dedicated to the worship of the god Amun, head of
            the
            Theban triad with Mut and Khonsu.</li>
          <li class="kkk">The establishment of a group of temples and architectural elements that were built by the
            kings of
            ancient Egypt from the Middle Ages until the Ptolemaic era. Recently discovered Ptolemaic and Roman baths in
            front of
            the first pylon. The Karnak Temple set for the goddess Mut which can be accessed through the Eastern Rams
            Road
            from
            the east, south, west, east, south, west, and race. He had been his princes to the god several times until
            the
            Ptolemaic era. The temple has two small temples within its walls; The first was dedicated to the god Khonsu
            and
            dates
            back to the reign of the Ten Thirteen Dynasty, while the second was dedicated to the worship of the god Amun
            and
            dates
            back to the era of Ramses III. The temple begins with an edifice, then a courtyard in which there are
            several
            statues
            of the goddess "Sekhmet" depicted in the form of a lady with the head of a lioness, which is an image of the
            goddess
            Mut. Then we reach another courtyard with columns, then the hall of the masters, followed by the Holy of
            Holies.

      <li class="kkk"> Is a large temple complex ancient Egyptian temples located on the eastern bank of the Nile River
        in the
        city of Luxor today known as (Thebes ancient). It was established in 1400 BC. [1] The Luxor Temple was built to
        worship Amun-Ra, his wife Mut, and their son Khonsu. They are the gods, which are also called the Theban Triad
        (the
        Triad of Thebes).</li>
      <li class="kkk"> Luxor Temple was built during the reign of the kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the Nineteenth
        Dynasty. The most important buildings in the temple are those that were built by Kings Amenhotep III (1397-1360
        BC)
        and Ramses II (1290-1223 BC) (who added to the temple the open courtyard, the edifice, and the obelisks). Also,
        King
        Thutmose III (1490-1436 BC) set up shrines for the visitors of the holy Theban Triad.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> Tutankhamun (1348-1337 BC) completed the engravings on its walls. The tripartite shrine that had
        been
        built before during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and King Thutmose III (of the Eighteenth Dynasty) was
        destroyed.
        Then it was rebuilt during the reign of King Ramses II.</li>
      <li class="kkk">The temple was also called “Iebet Reset” (meaning the southern sanctuary or the place of Amun-Ra)
        [2].
        It is one of the best preserved and most beautiful Egyptian temples, and in it the layout of the Egyptian temple
        is
        clearly evident [3]. </li>
      <li class="kkk"> The ancient architects originated the temple in the direction of a north-south axis, contrary to
        what
        was known at the time, where the temples were inaugurated in the direction of a west-east axis, yet the Luxor
        Temple
        (located on the eastern mainland) was built perhaps to be in a line with the group of the Karnak Temple, which
        is
        located To the north of it, and with the Sphinx road or the rams that used to connect the two temples.</li>

      <li class="kkk"> The Abu Simbel Temple in Aswan Governorate is one of the most famous ancient temples in Egypt, as
        the great Abu Simbel Temple is due to its association with the phenomenon of the sun perpendicular to the face
        of the statue of Pharaoh Ramses II twice a year, the first corresponding to October 22 and the second February
        22 of each year.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> This temple was built by King Ramses II Ramses II (about 1303 BC - 1213 BC), the most famous king
        of Egypt from the era of the New Kingdom, and it is believed that he sat on the throne in his late teenage years
        and ruled Egypt from 1279 BC to 1213 BC for a period of 67 years.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> The temple is distinguished by a unique architectural design, as its façade is pocked in the rock
        and decorated with four huge statues of King Ramses II, each of which is about 20 meters long.
        The facade is followed by a corridor leading to the interior of the temple that pecked in the rock at a depth of
        48 meters, and its walls are decorated with scenes recording the king's victories and conquests, including the
        battle of "Kadesh", in which he triumphed over the Hittites, in addition to the religious scenes that depict the
        king in his relations with the ancient Egyptian gods.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> This temple includes two of the most important rock temples in the far south of Egypt, namely Abu
        Simbel the Great, who was dedicated to the worship of "Ra Hor Akhatti" and "Amun Ra" and "Ptah" and the king
        himself, and stated that the temple is completely carved into the rock, and represents one of the miracles of
        engineering Architecture in the ancient world, as it took 20 years to sculpt the temple, and the axis of the
        temple was executed in such a way that it allowed sunlight to penetrate into the Holy of Holies twice a year on
        October 22 and February 22.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> And the small Abu Simbel temple, which is located 100 meters from the first temple, which was
        dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Queen Nefertari, the main wife of the king. King Ramses II gifted it to
        Queen Nefertari, his wife and his beloved, and its façade adorns 6 huge statues of equal size representing the
        king and the queen in a clear demonstration of the high status that she enjoyed She has the queen with her
        husband.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> Abu Simbel is an archaeological site located on the west bank of Lake Nasser, about 290 km
        southwest of Aswan. It is one of the "monuments of Nubia" listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. And that
        starts from the direction of the flow of the river from Abu Simbel to Philae (near Aswan).</li>
      <li class="kkk"> The twin temples were originally carved from the mountains during the reign of King Ramses II in
        the thirteenth century BC, as a permanent monument to him and Queen Nefertari, to commemorate his victory in the
        Battle of Kadesh.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> However, in 1960 the facility complex was completely moved to another location, on an artificial
        hill made of a dome structure, and over the Aswan High Dam reservoir.</li>
      <li class="kkk"> It was necessary to relocate the temples to avoid being submerged during the construction of Lake
        Nasser, and the huge artificial water reservoir was formed after the construction of the Aswan High Dam on the
        Nile River. Abu Simbel is still one of the best areas to attract tourism in Egypt.</li>
